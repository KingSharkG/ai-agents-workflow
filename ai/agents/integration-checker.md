# Agent: Integration Checker

## Mission

Perform a lightweight machine-oriented FE/BE compatibility check, including drift checks when only one side changed but the shared contract boundary may have moved.

## Runtime Contract

> The block below is read verbatim by `context-minimizer` on every dispatch and copied into this role's dispatch bundle (`## Role Contract` section). The surrounding prose in this file is human documentation — only the marker block is load-bearing at runtime. Edit with care: changes here take effect on the next dispatch.

<!-- role-contract:integration-checker -->
**Mission:** Perform a lightweight machine-oriented FE/BE compatibility check, including drift checks when only one side changed but the shared contract boundary may have moved.

**Skills:**
- `integration-check` — isolate contract breaks and emit the canonical Integration Check Report.
- `blocker-escalation-report` — missing context blocks comparison.

**Base plugins:** `github` — fetch PR diff, file contents, branch comparisons when contract surfaces live in GitHub PRs.

**Produce-artifact-first:** Append to `<!-- section:integration-check -->` in the FE subtask's `ai-work.md` (or the changed side's `ai-work.md` when only one side changed). The placeholder MUST already exist — if absent, raise Blocker Escalation. Required: `integration-metadata`, `integration-fe-surface`, `integration-be-surface`, `integration-verdict`, `integration-findings`, `integration-recommended-fixes`. If the IC covers two subtasks, note both in `integration-metadata` and include the BE subtask path under `integration-be-surface`.

If context is insufficient to compare contract surfaces safely, return a Blocker Escalation Report instead of prose.

**Allowed:** inspect changed FE/BE contract surfaces; compare field names, types, nullability, auth expectations; produce compact compatibility findings.

**Forbidden:** broad architectural redesign; feature re-planning; uncontrolled context expansion.

**Success:** detects likely FE/BE mismatch quickly; detects boundary drift even when only one side changed; findings explicit enough for a narrow fix; stays compact; telemetry + context manifest written.

**Bundle path convention:** `ai-workflow-data/tasks/<task_id>/[phase-X/]<subtask_id>/roles/integration-checker.md`
<!-- /role-contract:integration-checker -->

## Dispatch Bundle Protocol

The orchestrator writes a dispatch bundle file before each invocation. The bundle contains:
- Role contract excerpts (mission, comparison protocol, verdict rules, fix_owner assignment) from this file
- Pre-extracted PROJECT_CONFIG.md sections (API/auth baselines)
- Artifact input (changed-side implementation, untouched-side contract)

**Startup sequence:**
1. Harness reads the stub (`.claude/agents/integration-checker.md`) — spins up with tools, model, permissionMode.
2. Agent reads the dispatch bundle at the path provided in the orchestrator's prompt (`ai-workflow-data/tasks/<task_id>/[phase-X/]<subtask_id>/roles/integration-checker.md`).
3. Agent performs the compatibility check and appends to `ai-work.md`.

Do NOT independently read canonical contracts, PROJECT_CONFIG.md sections, or governance files. All necessary context is pre-curated in the dispatch bundle by the orchestrator via the `context-minimizer` skill.

## Base Plugins

- `github` — fetch PR diff, file contents, and branch comparisons when contract surfaces live in GitHub PRs.

## Produce-Artifact-First Rule (MANDATORY)

Protocol: `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/ai/governance/ARTIFACT_DISCIPLINE.md` → `<!-- section:produce-artifact-first -->`.

Target path: **append** to `<!-- section:integration-check -->` in the FE subtask's `ai-work.md` (or the changed side's `ai-work.md` when only one side changed). The placeholder MUST already exist — if absent, raise a Blocker Escalation.

Integration Check Report required sections (inside `<!-- section:integration-check -->`): `integration-metadata`, `integration-fe-surface`, `integration-be-surface`, `integration-verdict`, `integration-findings`, `integration-recommended-fixes`. Write diagnostics (telemetry line + context manifest subsection) to `<subtask_id>/summary.md`.

If context is insufficient to compare the active contract surfaces safely, return a Blocker Escalation Report instead of prose.

## Allowed Actions

- inspect changed FE and BE contract surfaces
- compare field names, types, nullability, and auth expectations
- produce compact compatibility findings

## Forbidden Actions

- broad architectural redesign
- feature re-planning
- uncontrolled context expansion

## Inputs

- changed-side `<!-- section:implementation -->` section extracts from `ai-work.md` — prefer `impl-files-changed`, `impl-tests-run`, `impl-unresolved-issues`; include full section only when the sectioned form is unavailable
- latest approved artifact or live contract surface from the untouched side when only one side changed
- relevant changed FE files or contract excerpts
- relevant changed BE files or contract excerpts
- API/Auth baseline excerpts

## Outputs

- `<!-- section:integration-check -->` appended to the FE subtask's `ai-work.md` (or the changed side's `ai-work.md` when only one side changed), sectioned with canonical `integration-*` markers.

When the IC report covers two subtasks simultaneously, note both subtask IDs in `integration-metadata` and include the BE subtask path under `integration-be-surface`. The report lives in one `ai-work.md` — the orchestrator routes the relevant findings excerpt to the executor(s) of each side.

## Success Criteria

- detects likely FE/BE mismatch quickly
- detects boundary drift even when only FE or only BE changed in the current cycle
- findings are explicit enough for a narrow fix
- stays compact and execution-oriented
- telemetry line written to `<subtask_id>/summary.md`
- context manifest subsection written to `<subtask_id>/summary.md`

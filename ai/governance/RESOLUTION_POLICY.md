# RESOLUTION_POLICY

Canonical policy for how agents resolve skills and plugins. Covers the resolution order, the fixed skill catalogs (global, reviewer, external), the approved plugin registry, intake/deprecation procedures, and the joint skill + plugin budget.

Any plugin not listed in `<!-- section:registry -->` with `status: approved` (or `trial`) MAY NOT be invoked. Using an unlisted or `deprecated` plugin is a hard blocker.

Plugins and skills that orchestrate competing end-to-end workflows are tracked separately in `ai/governance/FORBIDDEN_WORKFLOWS.md`. An entry appearing there is a hard blocker regardless of its status here. `RESOLUTION_POLICY.md` governs *which helpers agents may use*; `FORBIDDEN_WORKFLOWS.md` governs *which orchestrators agents may not become*.

## Fixed Before Dynamic

1. Agent-fixed skills (see `## Skills & Plugins` in each agent file, plus the role-generic sections below: `<!-- section:global-skills -->`, `<!-- section:reviewer-skills -->`).
2. Domain-fixed skills from `ai-workflow-data/config/PROJECT_CONFIG.md#<!-- section:<domain> -->` → `skills`. Domain-fixed skills are not declared in this file — they live entirely in the project overlay, so adding a new domain requires no change here.
3. Registry plugins (`<!-- section:registry -->`) — the single entry point for all plugins, whether MCP servers, Claude built-ins, or marketplace-distributed.
4. External skills (`<!-- section:external-skills -->`) — informational prefix-indexed mapping from skill prefix to provider plugin.
5. `npx skills find` as last resort.
6. Record dynamic skills used in Implementation Report. If nothing resolves, emit a `blocker-escalation-report` with `blocker_type: environment-capability-gap`.

## External Skills (Environment-Provided)

The following skills are referenced in agent contracts but provided by the tool environment (Claude Desktop, MCP plugins) — they do not exist as files in this repo. Each prefix maps to a plugin listed in `<!-- section:registry -->`; consult that row for `source` and `allowed_roles`.

| Prefix               | Skills                                                                                                                                                                                                          | Source                   |
| -------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------ |
| `superpowers:`       | `test-driven-development`, `verification-before-completion`, `finishing-a-development-branch`, `systematic-debugging`, `receiving-code-review` (plus `brainstorming`, `writing-plans`, `dispatching-parallel-agents`, `executing-plans`, `subagent-driven-development` — role-scoped; see `FORBIDDEN_WORKFLOWS.md`) | `claude-builtin`         |
| `frontend-design:`   | `frontend-design`                                                                                                                                                                                               | `claude-builtin`         |
| `figma:`             | `figma-use`, `figma-implement-design`, `figma-generate-library`, `figma-code-connect`                                                                                                                           | `mcp-server` (`figma`)   |
| `pr-review-toolkit:` | `silent-failure-hunter`, `pr-test-analyzer` (plus `review-pr`, `code-reviewer` — role-scoped; see `FORBIDDEN_WORKFLOWS.md`)                                                                                     | `claude-builtin`         |
| `code-review:`       | `code-review` (role-scoped; see `FORBIDDEN_WORKFLOWS.md`)                                                                                                                                                       | `claude-builtin`         |

The `feature-dev:` prefix is intentionally absent — it is denylisted in `FORBIDDEN_WORKFLOWS.md` because it orchestrates a competing end-to-end workflow. Consumers who want codebase-aware exploration or multi-option architecture should use ai-agents-workflow's `codebase-exploration` and `multi-approach-architecture` skills invoked by Lead.

If an agent references one of these and the environment does not provide it, the agent MUST emit a `blocker-escalation-report` (`blocker_type: environment-capability-gap`) rather than silently skipping.

## External Sources

Taxonomy of source types used in `<!-- section:registry -->` and `<!-- section:external-skills -->`. Every registry row declares exactly one `source` plus a `source_ref` describing how the plugin resolves at runtime.

| source                  | meaning                                                                  | resolution                                                                            |
| ----------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `local-plugin`          | This plugin's own agents / skills.                                       | Path under `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}`.                                                   |
| `mcp-server`            | MCP plugin already installed in the harness.                             | `source_ref` = MCP server id (visible via `/plugin`).                                 |
| `claude-builtin`        | Skill-provider plugin bundled in Claude Code.                            | `source_ref` = skill prefix (e.g. `superpowers:`, `pr-review-toolkit:`).              |
| `github-marketplace`    | Plugin distributed via a GitHub marketplace.                             | `source_ref` = `<owner>/<repo>`; consumer must run `/plugin marketplace add`.         |
| `consumer-marketplace`  | Marketplace the consumer added locally via `/plugin marketplace add`.    | `source_ref` = marketplace slug.                                                      |
| `npx-skills-find`       | Dynamic skill discovered at runtime.                                     | `source_ref = -`; governed by the dynamic-skill budget in `<!-- section:skill-budget -->`. |

Intake rule: new rows with `source ∈ {consumer-marketplace, npx-skills-find}` enter at `status: trial`.

`source_ref` is NOT version-pinned. Consumers pin specific versions via their own `/plugin` state, not via this registry.

**Role model:** `lead` and `executor` are generic. The `allowed_roles` column lists hard assignments (e.g., `chief-orchestrator` owns `github` regardless of project). Per-domain plugin assignments for lead/executor are declared in `ai-workflow-data/config/PROJECT_CONFIG.md#<!-- section:<domain> -->` → `plugins`. The merged allowlist for any subtask is `base_plugins ∪ PROJECT_CONFIG.<domain>.plugins`; invoking outside that union is a hard blocker.

<!-- /section:registry -->

<!-- section:fields -->

## Fields

- **name** — plugin identifier as invoked by the harness; this is what a consumer writes in `PROJECT_CONFIG.md`.
- **source** — one of the source types defined in `<!-- section:external-sources -->`.
- **source_ref** — provenance detail: MCP server id, Claude built-in prefix, marketplace slug, `<owner>/<repo>`, or `-` for `npx-skills-find`.
- **purpose** — one-line description of intended use.
- **allowed_roles** — roles permitted to invoke the plugin. Other roles MUST NOT call it.
- **cost_tier** — `low | medium | high`. Contributes to `telemetry.plugins_cost` accounting.
- **status** — `approved | trial | deprecated`.
  - `approved`: free to use within `allowed_roles`.
  - `trial`: usable, but every run invoking it MUST set `telemetry.plugins_cost: "high"` and cite this registry row.
  - `deprecated`: MUST NOT be invoked; remove callers.

<!-- /section:fields -->

<!-- section:intake -->

## Intake — Adding a New Plugin

1. Open a PR that edits **only** `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/ai/governance/RESOLUTION_POLICY.md`, proposing a new row under `<!-- section:registry -->` with all required columns filled — including `source` and `source_ref`.
2. New rows enter at `status: trial`. Rows with `source ∈ {consumer-marketplace, npx-skills-find}` MUST remain `trial` until promotion; see step 3.
3. Chief Orchestrator reviews: validates purpose, scopes `allowed_roles` to the minimum set, assigns a `cost_tier`.
4. After one successful task using the plugin under `trial`, Chief Orchestrator may promote `status: approved` in a follow-up PR.
5. While `status: trial`, every run using the plugin MUST flag `plugins_cost: "high"` regardless of count.

<!-- /section:intake -->

<!-- section:deprecation -->

## Deprecation

1. Change `status: deprecated` in `<!-- section:registry -->`.
2. Open blockers against any agent contract still referencing the plugin.
3. Remove plugin references from agent contracts (and from this file) once callers are gone.

<!-- /section:deprecation -->

<!-- section:plugin-budget -->

## Plugin Budget

Reported via `telemetry.plugins_cost` in every artifact.

- Using >2 distinct MCP plugins in a run → `plugins_cost: "high"`.
- `trial`-status plugins (see `<!-- section:fields -->`) MUST set `plugins_cost: "high"` regardless of count.
- `plugins_cost: high` combined with `dynamic_skills_cost: high` (see `<!-- section:skill-budget -->`) is a **soft blocker**: Chief Orchestrator must open a conversion review — pin plugin usage to a specific agent role, or convert dynamic skill → fixed role skill. **Conversion review** = a `blocker-escalation-report` with `blocker_type: budget-efficiency`, routed to the user (not an internal agent), listing which plugins/skills are high-cost, which runs triggered them, and a proposed lower-cost alternative for each.
- Executors MUST list plugins invoked under `plugins_used[]` in `IMPLEMENTATION_REPORT.md`, analogous to `used_dynamic_skills[]`.
- Invoking a plugin missing from `<!-- section:registry -->` (or with `status: deprecated`) is a **hard blocker**.

<!-- /section:plugin-budget -->

<!-- section:skill-budget -->

## Skill Budget (Dynamic Skills)

Applies to dynamic skills only. Reported via `telemetry.dynamic_skills_cost` in every artifact.

- Using >2 dynamic skills in a run → `dynamic_skills_cost: "high"`.
- `dynamic_skills_cost: high` combined with `plugins_cost: high` (see `<!-- section:plugin-budget -->`) is a **soft blocker**: Chief Orchestrator must open a conversion review — convert dynamic skill → fixed role skill, or pin plugin usage to a specific agent role. **Conversion review** = a `blocker-escalation-report` with `blocker_type: budget-efficiency`, routed to the user, listing high-cost plugins/skills and a proposed lower-cost alternative.
- Resolution order: agent-fixed skills → domain-fixed skills → registry plugins → external skills → `npx skills find` → stop.
